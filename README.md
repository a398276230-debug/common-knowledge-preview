# common-knowledge-preview
Enhances RimTalk Expand Memory's injection preview dialog with detailed keyword extraction and common knowledge scoring analysis.The code is derived from SANGUO and  AI generate. If it infringes on any rights or makes SANGUO uncomfortable, please contact me and I will delete it immediately.
Update: 
Added a feature to filter punctuation marks in the context, preventing keywords from being contaminated by punctuation.
Added a feature to clear the common knowledge cache after saving edited common knowledge tags, preventing edits from becoming invalid.
Added a "Forced Keywords" function. In the mod settings, you can now add specific keywords. If a keyword you've added is detected in the context but is not in the final output, it will be automatically added to the list, ensuring it gets triggered.
